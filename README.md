## Description

The library provides the following structures:
1. Delegate - a wrapper object for functions, methods or lambdas
2. Event - a collection of delegates. The event executes the code of all containing delegates

## Prerequisites

- C++17 or higher
- CMake >= 3.16

## Examples

### Function delegate

```cpp
function myFunction() {
    std::cout << "Print from function\n";
}

Hlk::Delegate<void()> del;
del.bind(myFunction);
del(); // Will print "Print from function" on the console
```

### Method delegate

```cpp
class A {
public:
    void printNumber(int number) {
        std::cout << "Print number from method: " << number << std::endl;
    }
};

A a;

Hlk::Delegate<void(int)> del;
del.bind(&a, &A::printNumber);
del(42); // Will print "Print number from method: 42" on the console
```

### Lambda delegate

```cpp
Hlk::Delegate<int(int, int)> del;
del.bind([] (int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
});

std::cout << "Sum 1 + 3 = " << del(1, 3) << std::endl; // Will print "Sum 1 + 3 = 4" on the console
```

### Event

```cpp
class EventHolder {
public:
    void fireEvent() {
        onSomeDataChanged();
    }

    Event<> onSomeDataChanged;
};

class EventHandler : public Hlk::NotifiableObject {
public:
    void someDataChangedHandler() {
        std::cout << "Some data changed\n";
    }
};

EventHolder eHolder;
EventHandler eHandler1, eHandler2;

eHolder.onSomeDataChanged.addEventHandler(&eHandler1, &EventHandler::someDataChangedHandler);
eHolder.onSomeDataChanged.addEventHandler(&eHandler2, &EventHandler::someDataChangedHandler);

eHolder.fireEvent(); // Will print "Some data changed" on the console twice
```

It's important to inherit EventHandler from Hlk::NotifiableObject because any objects with event handlers may be destroyed. If such object will be destroyed and before that it subscribe on the event, than next event firing will access to destroyed delegate handler. That may cause undefined behaviour. That's what the Hlk::NotifiableObject is needed for. Due to the execution of the destructor of this object, all handlers will be unsubscribed from the event before being destroyed.
