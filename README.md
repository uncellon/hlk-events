# Homebrew Libraries Kit - Events

## Design goals

The main goal is to create a simple and straightforward implementation of delegates and events.

## Examples

### Base delegate usage
```cpp
Hlk::Delegate<void(const std::string &)> printer;
printer.bind([] (const std::string &msg) {
    std::cout << msg << std::endl;
});
printer("My message");
```

### Events
```cpp
...

class A {
public:
    Hlk::Event<void()> onTriggered;

    void fireEvent() { onTriggered(); }
}

class B : public Hlk::NotifiableObject {
public:
    void triggeredHandler() { std::cout << "Class A triggered!\n"; }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    A a;
    B b;
    a.onTriggered.addEventHandler(&b, &B::triggeredHandler);
    a.fireEvent(); // After this call, the message "Class A triggered!" will appear in the program output
    return 0;
}

```
